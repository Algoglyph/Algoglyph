# npm & Package Ecosystem: Package Manifests, Semantic Versioning & Security

Managing package dependency configurations, version policies, and codebase vulnerability audits.

---

## 1. package.json vs package-lock.json

Dependency management is defined by manifest files:
- `package.json`: Declares package metadata, custom build scripts, and direct dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Pins the exact nested dependency versions installed, ensuring consistent builds across environments.

---

## 2. Semantic Versioning (SemVer) Breakdown

SemVer uses a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format (e.g. `2.4.1`):
- `MAJOR`: Incompatible API modifications.
- `MINOR`: Backward-compatible feature updates.
- `PATCH`: Backward-compatible bug fixes.
- Caret (`^1.4.0`): Permits automatic upgrades of Minor and Patch releases.
- Tilde (`~1.4.0`): Restricts upgrades strictly to Patch revisions.

---

## 3. Dependency Management & Security Audits

Securing external third-party codebases is critical:
- `dependencies`: Needed for application execution.
- `devDependencies`: Needed during development (e.g. TypeScript, test suites).
- Run `npm audit` to check for security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in dependency trees.
- Run `npm ci` in automated environments to install dependencies directly from the lockfile.

---

## 4. Custom Scripts & Package Resolution

Custom scripts automate development pipelines:
- `scripts`: Define commands like `dev`, `build`, and `test`.
- Node.js resolves modules by searching parent `node_modules` folders recursively.

## Extra Technical Deep-Dive & Advanced Engineering Cases

To build complex enterprise systems, engineers must understand advanced implementation concerns:
- **Design Pattern Adaptability**: Ensure systems separate computational logic from user display scopes.
- **Security Layer Isolation**: Sanitize inputs to prevent common injection attacks and data leakage.
- **Caching strategies**: Implement layer 2 in-memory caching to optimize system workloads.
- **Memory Leak Mitigation**: Remove listeners, dispose references, and clear interval timers.
- **Compilation Optimization**: Leverage compiler optimizations to streamline package outputs.
- **Automated Validation checks**: Standardize lint checks and build runs to catch syntax regressions early.

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### Q1: Why should package-lock.json be committed?
It locks exact transitive package versions, ensuring everyone on the team and production CI environments build the exact same codebase.

### Q2: What is the difference between dependencies and devDependencies?
`dependencies` run in production code. `devDependencies` are development-only tooling (like linters, compilers, and test runners).

### Q3: What does npm ci do?
`npm ci` bypasses package.json, deletes node_modules, and installs packages strictly from package-lock.json, making it faster and safer for CI pipelines.

### Q4: How does the Caret (^) differ from the Tilde (~)?
`^` permits minor and patch updates (e.g. ^1.2.3 matches <2.0.0). `~` allows patch updates only (e.g. ~1.2.3 matches <1.3.0).

### Q5: How do I fix dependency vulnerability reports?
Use `npm audit` to identify vulnerabilities, and run `npm audit fix` to automatically update packages to patched versions.
